# ðŸ’¾ Platform Compatibility

RPG Eldoria is compatible with:
- **Windows** (fully supported)
- **Linux** (tested on Ubuntu and derivatives)
- **macOS** (may require extra permissions for SDL2)

## Known Issues
- On macOS, you may need to allow execution of SDL2 binaries.
- On Linux, install SDL2 dependencies via your package manager.
- Audio and font rendering may vary slightly between platforms due to Pygame/SDL2 differences.
