# 🛡️ Upgrade System

The player upgrade system is planned to be implemented in future versions of the game. The idea is to allow players to evolve their characters through improvements in skills, equipment, and attributes. ⚔️🛠️

It is worth mentioning that the upgrade system was already completed in previous versions of the game. However, issues related to SDL2 are currently preventing the correct rendering of upgrades. 🐞 We intend not only to fix these problems, but also to improve the system, making it more useful and efficient than in previous versions, as well as implementing a new design for the upgrade interface. 🎨

## 🏆 Initial Planning
- Players will be able to acquire upgrade points by completing quests or reaching certain milestones in the game. 🎯
- These points can be used to unlock or enhance specific skills, increase attributes (such as strength, agility, intelligence), or improve equipment. 💪
- The system will be designed to offer strategic choices, allowing for different progression styles and character customization. 🧩
- In the future, the upgrade system interface will be integrated into the game's main menu. 🗺️

This feature is currently in the planning stage and may change as development progresses. 🔄
