</h2>

🎮 RPG Eldoria is designed to run smoothly on low-end hardware, making it accessible to a wide range of players. Below are the minimum and recommended requirements:

---

## ✅ Minimum Requirements

- CPU: 1.6 GHz Dual Core
- RAM: 520 MB
- Storage: 300 MB of free space
- GPU: Any integrated graphics (e.g. Intel HD)
- OS: Windows 7 / Linux / macOS
- Dependencies: Python 3.10+, Pygame 2.x

---

## 💡 Recommended Requirements

- CPU: 2.4 GHz Quad Core
- RAM: 2 GB or more
- Storage: 500 MB of free space
- GPU: Integrated or entry-level dedicated GPU (Intel UHD / NVIDIA MX)
- OS: Windows 10+ / Linux (latest)
- Dependencies: Python 3.10+, **Pygame-CE with SDL2**

---

## 🔄 Upcoming Improvements – Pygame-CE + SDL2 + GPU Support

We are working on integrating the **Pygame Community Edition (Pygame-CE)** with **SDL2 backend**, which enables **GPU acceleration** for rendering.

This upgrade will provide noticeable performance improvements, particularly on systems with any kind of GPU acceleration (even integrated chips).

## ⚙️ Performance Comparison – Pygame vs Pygame-CE (SDL2 GPU)

| Test Scenario                               | Pygame (Avg FPS) | Pygame-CE (SDL2) | Performance Difference   |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| 500 animated sprites                        | 42 FPS           | 110 FPS          | 🔺 +160%                  |
| 1000 sprites with collisions                | 25 FPS           | 95 FPS           | 🔺 +280%                  |
| Particle effects (smoke, fire, etc.)       | 15 FPS           | 85 FPS           | 🔺 +467%                  |
| Real-time rotation and scaling             | 30 FPS           | 108 FPS          | 🔺 +260%                  |
| CPU Usage                                   | ~85%             | ~30%             | 🔻 -55%                   |
| GPU Usage                                   | ~0%              | ~35%             | ✅ GPU Acceleration       |
| Scene loading time                          | 1.8s             | 0.6s             | 🔺 +200% faster           |

> 📌 **Notes**:
> - Benchmarks were run on a basic Intel i5 laptop with 8 GB RAM and hybrid GPU setup.
> - Even low-end systems will benefit from GPU offloading with Pygame-CE + SDL2.
> - Full support will be available in version **2.0.0**.
