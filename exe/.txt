The .exe file may be outdated due to optimizations, 
bug fixes, or recent changes in the game's code. 
Since development is constantly evolving, some versions 
may temporarily become outdated until they are recompiled 
and made available again.

If you notice that the available version does not include the latest 
improvements or announced features, we recommend running the game directly 
through main.py or waiting until the .exe is recompiled and updated to the 
latest version.
